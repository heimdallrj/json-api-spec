# json:api:spec

A minimalistic specification for building RESTful APIs in JSON.

This project inspired after [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org/)

**{json:api}** is undoubtedly one of the best API specifications and this project has no intention of replacing it. This approach is proposing more of a minimalistic, but scalable API Spec. which can use building RESTful APIs.
